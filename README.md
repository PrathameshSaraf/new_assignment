In this project, I used the Stacked architecture, which is a lightweight MVVM-inspired architecture that promotes separation of concerns and reactive programming in Flutter apps.
Stacked implements separation of concerns and dependency injection by building Flutter code around 3 entities: Views, ViewModels, and Services.
